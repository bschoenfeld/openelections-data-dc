### Script for processing 2004 DC results

Not sure how generalizable it is, but maybe it will be helpful on the other DC records.

Included the raw outputs from [Tabula](http://tabula.technology/) in the `2004` folder. It works with python 2 or 3.

Run the parser from this folder and pass it `general`, `ward` or `precinct`
